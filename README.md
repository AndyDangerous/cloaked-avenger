# On The Way To

You're heading to a friend's house for dinner and want to bring a bottle of wine. This API will help you find a liquor store along the way. There are plenty of other use cases, but this is the *raison d'Ãªtre*.

There are a bunch of current unknowns (both known and unknown). In an ideal world. I could just find another API to handle buffering the directions and searching within the resulting polygon. It turns out that's a little tough to find.

In the mean time, I think I'm going to fire up a PostGIS DB to store my points and do the heavy lifting on the geo side. At least I can get the data reasonably easily from Dr.Cog.
